title: Feedback
---

We've always thrived on feedback from every angle possible: from audience, from other organizers, guests etc.  All the incremental improvements that happened were pretty much a direct outcome of the outside-in feedback we seek and get.  In the beginning, folks gave feedback by not showing up but when one really courageous attendee told us on our face that we were pushing our startup agenda too much, it just his us what the meetup should really be all about: the audience and their needs.  Since then, we really kept an open mind, always focused on the audience needs and engagement.

All that said, we do get some formal feedback through a couple channels.

1. Meetup reviews: We get outstanding reviews on our meetup where our audience profusely thank our special guests and organizers on the various elements of the meetup.  We probably have the best reviews/members ratio on the entire meetup.  Checkout some sweet reviews [here](https://www.meetup.com/I-want-to-work-for-______________/about/comments/?op=all).
1. Special feedback sessions: We don't do this as often but once a year, we schedule a session specifically to get intimate feedback on the current career needs and gaps in the industry.  We've gotten some unexpected feedback from these sessions and over time incorporated that feedback into our format and other elements of the meetup.  We are hoping to do more of such feedback sessions in the future as well.

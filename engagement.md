title: Engagement

Obviously engagement is pretty big deal for meetup success, especially in Portland.  I am willing to bet there are more meetups per capita in Portland compared to any other city.
So engagement is critical both for repeat audience and word-of-mouth viral marketing.  Here's some proven strategies that worked well for us.

##Photos on meetup.com
We regularly take photos of our audience and guests at every one of the meetup and post them back on meetup.com in the photos section.  This gives us an opportunity to tag folks and acknowledge their presence in one additional way.

##One Takeway
Probably my favorite section of the meetup itself is called "one takeaway".  Towards the end of every meetup, all the audience members and the guests take turns sharing what is the one takeaway, or lesson, or habit that they will start as a result of their attendance at the meetup.  I have a small voice recorder that I pass around where they record their takeaway.  This reinforces the value of being at the meetup and in turn keeps bringing them back.

##Book raffle giveaways
We also a do a book raffle (2 books right now, one is [Startup of You](http://www.thestartupofyou.com/) and the second one is [Nerd Life Balance](https://leanpub.com/nerdlifebalance)).  Attendees share their name and email address and at the end, we do raffle for these two books.  Great way to thank for attending and sharing their opinions.

##Plenty of time for audience questions and interruptions
We have semi-formal Q&A with the special guest at each event.  However, interruptions from audience members are not only welcome but highly encouraged.  At some point we realized that our audience really like to interact with our influential guests, so we started encouraging that throughout the Q&A itself.  That unique, casual atmosphere turned out to be a great hit and we've continued and thrived on that tradition ever since.

Of all the things we experimented with, marketing is most exciting, as the rewards 
are quite fulfilling in the form of increased members/attendees and magnified interactions.

Here's various things we tried, some successful, others that bombed miserably:

### Powered by Free Pizza
Right from the get go, I was hoping to have a large audience at the meetups.  So in
desperation, I offered free food (pizza) to all attendees paid from my pocket!
In my naivete, I wanted to proudly proclaim that we were offering pizza.  We even
suffixed every one of our meetup titles with the cheesy phrase "POWERED by Free Pizza".
I don't know if that helped us attract more attendees, but it did become a catchphrase.
In almost every one of the meetup sessions, there is a joke or two about that phrase 
and how one or more attendees came just to eat pizza without any interest in the meetup itself.
Obviously, our meetups are interesting enough to engage attendees so we generally don't attract
freeloaders and every penny we spend on the pizzas is totally worthwhile :)

### Blogs
After about a year or so into the startup, I got hooked into writing blogs, especially
on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com).  Since then I started writing up to 3 blogs per month
specifically geared towards attracting attendees.

* **Welcome the special guest**: About a week or so before the actual event, I usually write a
blog welcoming the special guest to our meetup and include a blurb about why we chose that person as the guest.  This blog is generally targeted at people in my network (over 2500 strong as of March 2017).  It also provides an avenue for the guests themselves, their company's HR/marketing teams to promote to their own professional networks.  All-in-all, this one type of blog generally attracts a good percentage of our overall attendees.  Plus, its a nice goodwill gesture to promote our awesome special guests anyways!

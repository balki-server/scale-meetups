Of all the things we experimented with, marketing is most exciting, as the rewards 
are quite fulfilling in the form of increased members/attendees and magnified interactions.

Here's various things we tried, some successful, others that bombed miserably:

### Powered by Free Pizza
Right from the get go, I was hoping to have a large audience at the meetups.  So in
desperation, I offered free food (pizza) to all attendees paid from my pocket!
In my naivete, I wanted to proudly proclaim that we were offering pizza.  We even
suffixed every one of our meetup titles with the cheesy phrase "POWERED by Free Pizza".
I don't know if that helped us attract more attendees, but it did become a catchphrase.
In almost every one of the meetup sessions, there is a joke or two about that phrase 
and how one or more attendees came just to eat pizza without any interest in the meetup itself.
Obviously, our meetups are interesting enough to engage attendees so we generally don't attract
freeloaders and every penny we spend on the pizzas is totally worthwhile :)

### Blogs
After about a year or so into the startup, I got hooked into writing blogs, especially
on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com).  Since then I started writing up to 3 blogs per month
specifically geared towards attracting attendees.

* **Welcome the special guest**: About a week or so before the actual event, I usually write a
blog welcoming the special guest to our meetup and include a blurb about why we chose that person as the guest.  This blog is generally targeted at people in my network (over 2500 strong as of March 2017).  It also provides an avenue for the guests themselves, their company's HR/marketing teams to promote to their own professional networks.  All-in-all, this one type of blog generally attracts a good percentage of our overall attendees.  Plus, its a nice goodwill gesture to promote our awesome special guests anyways!
* **Lessons Learned**: One of the coolest sections in each of our meetup session happens right before we end the formal interview section.  Every attendee shares their #1 takeaway from the 
special guest and other attendees.  I capture those gems of ideas with a voice recorder and turn
them into a cool blog entry.  Attendees as well as prospects tend to enjoy this recap which is
another chance for us to showcase the special guest/featured company.
* **Career topic**: From time to time I also write a blog about a specific career topic,
usually inspired by a question that comes up during the meetup session.  I have to admit I do
these blogs less often than I want but hoping to change that soon and write at least one 
blog a month.

### Meetup.com
[Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com) is inherently social.  They do a pretty good job of 
marketing your meetup to the right people.  We did do a few experiments with how we categorize
our own meetup.  Meetup allows XXX categories (for good reason I would say) per meetup.  I am not quite sure if the categories themselves made any difference, but we settled on the following for our meetup.

*Professional Networking · Social · Self-Improvement · Technology · Professional Development · Career Network · Networking for Job Seekers · Job Search · Career · Social Networking · Finding a New Job · 20's & 30's Social · New In Town · Young Professionals*

By far we get the most attendees (~65%) from meetup.com directly.  So, thank you meetup.com!

### Promoting on other channels
Targeting is quite important when selecting your marketing channels.  Given the broad nature of our meetup, we had a rich spectrum of digital and offline channels.  Through several iterations we settled on the following:

* Code Schools : Students and placement staff at the various code schools in Portland really appreciate exposure to growing companies.  Over time we built great relationships with these code schools and I have always invited folks from these code schools, especially if the tech stacks they teach (.Net, or Python, or Ruby) matches the one used at our featured company.

* Calagator.org : A surprising number of tech meetup followers trust calagator.org and we've always used that channel and I would say around 20% of our attendees come via this channel.

* Word-of-mouth : We are lucky to have built a loyal following over the last couple years.  Many of these folks refer to our meetup as they go around in the meetup circles.

* My network : A lot of folks reach out to me via my growing network to seek advice or tap into my professional network.  I firmly believe that these folks will benefit greatly by learning from our special guests and other attendees.  So I redirect all of these folks to the meetup as the first

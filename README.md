A number of our entrepreneurial friends asked me about how we have been scaling our 
meetup [I want to work for _ _ _ _ _ ](http://www.balki.io/meetup).  We do some unique
things at our meetup that we felt could be useful for anyone starting or scaling
their meetups.

This is our first attempt to open-source the best practices and techniques so anyone
can contribute and benefit from our learnings.

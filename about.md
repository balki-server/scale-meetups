We started our [meetup group](http://www.balki.io/meetup) just 2 years ago in December 2014.  The meetup group grew rapidly in that 2 years reaching ~1500 by February 2017.
In the spirit of the true startup we constantly experimented not just with the structure,
but everything else including food, marketing, structure, location etc.  

There are several meetups including our own in Portland that we love and model from:

* [I want to work for _ _ _ _ _ _](http://www.balki.io/meetup)
* [PADNUG](https://www.meetup.com/PADNUG/)
* [FutureTalks](https://www.meetup.com/New-Relic-FutureTalks-PDX/)

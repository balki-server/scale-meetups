We started hosting at [Forge Portland](http://www.forgeportland.org/) right from day #1.  The hosts there are personable, reasonable and trusting.  Plus the environment there somehow resonates with us and our audience.  For a brief period, about 6 months, we were lucky to host at the gorgeous New Relic community center in the US Bank tower (while I worked there).  That is another awesome venue if you can pull off a connection or an employee there.

In August 2017, unfortunately Forge Portland shut down.  So we did a bunch of research (due to our shoestring budget limitations) and ended up choosing the beautiful [Regus - Pearl District](https://www.regus.com/office-space/united-states/oregon/portland/oregon-portland-pearl-district) as our new home.  The place is beautiful, accessbile and the hosts gracious!

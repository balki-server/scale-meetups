We started hosting at [Forge Portland](http://www.forgeportland.org/) right from day #1.  The hosts there are personable, reasonable and trusting.  Plus the environment there somehow resonates with us and our audience.  For a brief period, about 6 months, we were lucky to host at the gorgeous New Relic community center in the US Bank tower (while I worked there).  That is another awesome venue if you can pull off a connection or an employee there.

When we first started, we ambitiously thought we didn't need speakers or special guests.  That lasted like 2 months.  Within those two months we realized that our audience were yearning to learn from experts in the field which then turned into influencers and leaders from respective companies.

Over time we built one of the best networks in Portland into the tech community.  As of early 2017, we have a guest list thats 18 months deep and growing.  And since late 2016, we actually have influencers from various top-notch companies and their agents pushing us to be special guests at our meetup.  We are fortunate to be in such a wonderful situation for guests.

We also take really good care of our speakers/guests from the get-go.  I personally connect with the guest(s) and always keep them in the know about expectations.

Over a series of emails, we collaboratively decide on various elements of the meetup including:
* Logistics
* Expectations
* Format
* Questions (those to cover and not)

And we always give a decent bottle of wine as a small token of appreciation for our special guests.

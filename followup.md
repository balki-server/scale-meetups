##Welcome on meetup.com
We get a constant stream of new members any given week (1400+ members and counting as of April 2017).  For each new member, I take the time to write a personal welcome message, offering to explain how the meetup works, who our upcoming guests/companies are, connect on LinkedIn etc.  We get a nice conversion to actual attendance given this personalized messaging on top of the stock messages that meetup sends our our behalf.

##Connect on LinkedIn
Based on the above sign-up list for the raffle prize (that happens at the end of meetup session), I usually follow-up with each person individually via email.  I also send them a LinkedIn invite and offer to help in any way possible.  This helps both that members and special guests expand their professional networks.  And it gives them the courage to seek help from the organizers if they need it.

##Offer to do a 25-min video call
For most folks I also extend a 1x1 25-min video call option if they need help organizing their job search, or making connections or help with resume, cover letter etc.

##Share new meetup blogs
We sometimes give a heads-up to past and regular attendees about an important guest coming to our meetup.  We do this by sending an email showcasing the blog I write about that special guest.  This helps us stay in touch with our audience as well as bringing them back if they see a potential connection opportunity with the showcased company.

##Connect on LinkedIn
Based on the above sign-up list for the raffle prize, I usually follow-up with each person individually via email.  I also send them a LinkedIn invite and offer to help in any way possible.  This helps both that members and special guests expand their professional networks.  And it gives them the courage to seek help from the organizers if they need it.

##Offer to do a 25-min video call
For most folks I also extend a 1x1 25-min video call option if they need help organizing their job search, or making connections or help with resume, cover letter etc.

##Share new meetup blogs
We sometimes give a heads-up to past and regular attendees about an important guest coming to our meetup.  We do this by sending an email showcasing the blog I write about that special guest.  This helps us stay in touch with our audience as well as bringing them back if they see a potential connection opportunity with the showcased company.

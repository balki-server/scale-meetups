title: Funding
---

We've always self-sponsored the meetup, first as a startup we ran the meetup was an extension.  Even after moved on from the startup, we continued to fund the meetup ourselves.  It costs us around $200 a month to make this meetup happen.  We talked a few times about inviting sponsors but always go back to funding it ourselves.

As we scale, we are again talking about what elements of the scale need funding and who would be the right partners.  A couple of recruiting companies in Portland are very keen on sponsoring and we might try partnering with one of them in the near future.
